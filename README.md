# 13-Mapping-Earthquakes

## Basic Project Plan
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Tasks
To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map.

### Approach
Your approach will be to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. You'll use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.

## Mapbox
Mapbox provides custom maps for websites and applications such as Strava, Facebook, the Financial Times, The Weather Channel, Snapchat, and Instacart. Since October 2019, Mapbox has been generating up to 14 billion individual sensor readings daily across 100,000 map updates on connected devices.

## Branching in GitHub

Branching makes it possible to create an isolated environment when creating a new feature, or to correct an issue in the main code no matter the scope.

Creating branches off the main branch is where Git shines. A branch allows you to make changes to the main code "off to the side," like a branch on a tree. Once the code on the branch has been reviewed and approved, only then can the branch be merged into the main branch. This ensures that the main branch always contains production-quality code.
